==== 2.0
The reasons it's 2.0 and not 1.2
* File list is now case insensitive.
* Changed usermanager to javabeans (use UserManagerConverter to convert).
  UserManager now supports adding dynamic properties (with runtime type checking).
* Dropped slaves.xml, use site [add|del]slave etc. commands.
  Uses javabeans for storage.
* Changed keys in .properties formatting, now using dynamic user data as keys.
* Added symlinks.
* Dropped RMI in favor of our own master<->slave protocol which will scale
  much better.
* Includes Teflon's ircusermanager which now uses dynamic user data.
* Permissions now configurable for every site and irc command.
* Blowfish support added to SiteBot

In progress:
* Dropped glob-style path permissions in favor of ants pattern path expressions.
* Now requires java 5.0
* Now requires ant to build, no more binary .class files.
  JDK is required by ant, JRE is not sufficient.
