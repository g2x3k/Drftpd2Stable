* Port r1683 from trunk:
  
  java.io.File.list() may return null when the directory no longer
  exists or when an I/O error occurs. In either case, we have
  successfully deleted the file already so we can return as usual.
  This change makes sure we do not use a null pointer when list()
  returns null.
  
  Thanks to Dom for reporting this issue and helping to provide a
  root cause and potential fixes. Also thanks to zubov for his
  useful input.

* Excellent write-up provided for a possibility of causing the
  ActiveConnection to be slow. In the case where dns servers are
  unresponsive, the lookup request could delay the connection long
  enough to disrupt the connection and create a timeout. The lookup
  was only done for human readable logging, so we'll just log the
  IPs instead. Thanks!

* SFVFile Interface updated -- Overloaded getTotalBytes() to allow
  it to return bytes for only completed files, not just those being
  transfered.

  SFV, including those still being transfered.

  the expected size of a completed directory which contains an SFV
  file.
