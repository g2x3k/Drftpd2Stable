# FUNCTION       | PATH     | GROUP
# * = only wildcard recognized
# = denotes group, - denotes user

# EXAMPLES
# upload * =siteop
# download * -user1
# makedir /usercanmakedir/* -user1 -user2 =group1
# To expand on the help, rules run left to right, top to bottom
# eg. user 'LoginA' is in group 'GroupB'
#upload * -LoginA !=GroupB <=- even tho LoginA is a member of GroupB , he can still upload,
#				- but everyone else in GroupB cannot.
#upload * !=GroupB -LoginA <=- even tho it 'says' LoginA can upload, he can't because rule hits !=GroupB
#				- and sees that LoginA is a part of that group and denies him the upload
#Also, !* is implied at the end of each rule

# DrFTPD+ Regular Expression based command filtering.
# These filter are ALWAYS checked against the complete path of a file or a direcory
#
# Eg.1:
# Current Path = /TEST.DIR/ -> MKD TEST
# The filter will see this as 'MKD /TEST.DIR/TEST/'
# Eg.2:
# Current Path = /TEST.DIR/ -> STOR test.upload
# The filter will see this as 'STOR /TEST.DIR/test.upload'
#
# Syntax:
# filter 	<MKD|STOR|RETR|RNTO|RNFR|WIPE>	regexp					perms
# Read this topic for some regexp samples...
#
# For more information, ideas, and user submitted example filters,
# check out the RegexFilter wiki article on the drftpd website:
